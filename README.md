# Hi there! If you happened to stumble upon this repository, then let me tell you what it is you'll find here. (And if you're a preexisting tester, you should already know where the pack files are.)

### This repository, as it stands, is for holding the test packs for the [ZF Community pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/zf-community) (name change pending), before being uploaded to CurseForge.

### If you want to help with pack testing, join my [discord](https://discord.gg/uMMPaze), fill out the application and I (McSquizzleswag) will give you a role that grants you access to my Minecraft server (as long as you own the game)

(This repository might get moved to my organization page, but not sure yet ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)
